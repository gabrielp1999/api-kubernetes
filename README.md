# Kubernetes and Docker Setup

This project contains configurations for Docker and Kubernetes.

## Files

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image for the application, including the base image, dependencies, and build instructions.
- **deploy.yaml**: Contains the Kubernetes deployment configuration, specifying the pods, replicas, and other resources needed to deploy the application.

These files work together to containerize the application and deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster.
